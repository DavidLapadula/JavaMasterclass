- can setPriority() on thread. Just suggestion, not binding for order
- Sync blocks NOT first come first serve, so setting priority can result in starvation
- Fair lock
    - try to be first come first serve, just pass 'true' to Reentrant Lock
    - trylock() not FCFS; fairness reduces performance because more processing to guarantee fairness
- Livelock
    - A loops until B finishes, B loops until A finishes. If both looping in a livelock. Threads not blocked, but try to respond to each other continuously
    - Not blocked but dont progress
