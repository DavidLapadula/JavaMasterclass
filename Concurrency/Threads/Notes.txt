- Threads
    - Unit of execution within process. Handle memory or IO. Main thread created automatically
        - Each thread has stack, memory only for that thread
    - Process: unit of execution with memory space
    - Each process has own heap, and processes cannot share heaps or access those of others
    - Every thread within process shares its memory and files
    - Thread can only do 1 thing at a time, suspended while it is waiting
        - Create other thread for long task, and free up main thread
    - System schedules when they will run (no guaranteed order)
    - Can setPriority(), but cant force threads to run in order, just a suggestion
    - When reach end of run(), thread will terminate
    - Need to call start(), if call run() will run on Thread that called it
    - Sleep() to allow other thread to do work, or to wait, or to do something at interval
    - OS dependant as to what happens, could not support what is being asked of it
    - Could wake up periodically to check if there is work to do
- Concurrency
    - Progress can be made on more than 1 task
    - One task doesnt have to complete before another can start
- New thread class, can create instance of subclass and override 'run'
    - start() to kick off thread.
    - Need new instance of Thread subclass to execute start()
    - Can use anonymous class, but have to start it immediately
- Runnable
    - Create a thread, but make class implement this interface and override run
    - Pass new instance of class to Thread constructor
    - Most methods of Java want instance of Runnable
- Interrupt
    - Stop thread because want it to stop
    - Could catch interrupted exception, or run() checks to see if it has been interrupted
    - Call interrupt on thread instance it wants to interrupt (needs instance)
    - If catch Interrupted Exception, was interrupted and need to return
- Join
    - Join A TO B (A is calling the join), will wait for B to terminate before continuing execution
    - Call join() of other thread you want to join current thread to
        - Can pass timeout to join, A will wait for B to be done, or for terminate to happen
