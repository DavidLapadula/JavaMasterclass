- When thread is running objects synchronized method, no other thread can run sync method using same object
- When sync on method, method needs to get lock on object it is using in method
- Deadlock
    - Multiple threads blocked on lock, multiple threads holding a lock that another thread wants
    - Waiting threads will never run
    - Usually caused by order threads are trying to acquire locks
    - Solution
        - Require all threads get locks in same order, so secondary thread either waits for other thread to release lock, instead of acquiring another lock the primary thread may need
        - Make sure one thread cannot hold one of the locks and not the other
- Starvation
    - Rarely have opportunity to run, often occurs because of priority
    - Sync. methods ARE NOT first come first serve
