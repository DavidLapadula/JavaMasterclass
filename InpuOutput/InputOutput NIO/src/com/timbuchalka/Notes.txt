- Files class of NIO allows you to create BufferedWriter as long as give it a path instance, so need to use FileSystem getPath for file you are writing to first
    - NIO classes work with 'Path' instances, not instance of 'File'
- Can create object input/output stream from a path
    - Use path instance to create output stream
    - Wrap Files.newOutputStream in BufferedOutputStream, which is itself wrapped in ObjectOutputStream
        - Can also use for InputStream, as long as it descends from Input|Output stream
