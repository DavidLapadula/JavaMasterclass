- By default Label control will show toString() of class passed in, so that needs to be overwritten
- Selection model class whcih tracks which item in list has been selected
- VGrow=Always: give other elements preferred height and rest goes the TextArea. Used to maximize space for TextArea when the rest of the items are small
- Singleton
    - Only 1 instance of a class created over the course of the application
    - Creates single instance of itself, with private constructor to ensure no other instances made
    - Static method to allow any class to get its method
    - Because cannot instantiate, need to go constructor > getInstance > getItems to get the data
