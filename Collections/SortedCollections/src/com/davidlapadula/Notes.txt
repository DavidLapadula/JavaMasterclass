- Linked variants with an order; ordering usually chaotic with these two interfaces but linked version maintains order
    - getOrDefault(): either return the item at the key of first arg or set item in second arg. Returns item either way
    - toString() made for debugging, so should not override it to make long logs
    - unmodifiableMap() instead of returning new Map and tricking users into thinking they can modify, return readOnly.
        - Faster than copy because do not need to make a copy in memory
    - Unmodifiablemap is just view into underlying Map
        - Only the collection is unmodifiable, the individual items can be modified when they are called.
    - If nothing should be modified, than return unmodifiable options for collections and what they house; use an additional getter for this
        - If class does not have get method, than unmodifiable method should not have get either, or else will have access to items this way
Linked HashMap/ HashMap
    - Maintains order of the keys
Tree Map
    - More computing because every time you add an item, compareTo() gets called to maintain the order of the items
    - Checks list for place to insert next item
