	        - Collections framework
	            - Static methods work on collections
	            - Interfaces - enforce methods on all collections and allow them to be extended
	            - Allow interoperability between other collections
	            - Algorithms that work on objects that implement Collections interface
            - If use collection for DS, because Collection is an interface can use any of classes that implements it as interface (set, list, queue, deque)
            - BUT to implement needs to be at the same level of the collections hierarchy
            - Comparable interface allows the use of binary search when 'compareTo' method is overridden
                - Ex. String has built in compareTo method
