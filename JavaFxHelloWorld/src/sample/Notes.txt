- Overview
    - MVC design pattern
    - Code for UI, code for data separate with controller as middle
    - Change the view without ever touching code, only doing the view
    - Entry is class that extends Application
        - Launch starts it, init() runs first, then start(), then end()
        - init() and end() are empty in Application class, so need to override it for it to do anything
    - Stage (Top Level)
        - Container, or main window. Passed into start method
        - Each stage requires a scene, and each scene requires a scene graph or controller for that section of the UI
        - Parent descends from class, which is base class for scene graph nodes
            - Nodes that descend from 'Parent' can have children in the same graph
    - FMXL Loader
        - Says which controller is for that class (fx:controller)
        - load() will return scene graph, which has multiple nodes (UI components), and usually 1 root node
        - Create 'Scene' need to pass in root that will back the scene (root created by FXML load())
        -
    - FXML allows you to separate UI from Data, also easier to change when it is in the view
