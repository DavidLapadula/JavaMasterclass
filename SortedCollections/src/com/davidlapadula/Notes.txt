    - getOrDefault(): either return the item at the key of first arg or set item in second arg. Returns item either way
    - toString() made for debugging, so should not override it to make long logs
    - unmodifiableMap() instead of returning new Map and tricking users into thinking they can modify, return readOnly.
        - Faster than copy because do not need to make a copy in memory
